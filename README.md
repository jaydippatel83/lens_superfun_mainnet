## Inspiration 

If we share a meme on Twitter, we can't access it on Facebook but SuperFun ensures maximum composability as it is powered by Lensprotcol, Filecoin, and Polygon. 

Meme is a universal language of the Internet and we all know how fast information gets spread through Memes so our aim is to become a goto platform for Meme Artists to generate value for their creativity and brands to create meme contests to crowdsource memes from the best artists and spread a message for their product. 


## What it does

SuperFun is A social meme app built with Lens Protocol where meme artists get rewarded with crypto for super fun content and brands can create contests to crowdsource memes from the best artists. 


## How we built it 

-Currently, it is deployed on Testnet. We have created a profile on Lens so need to sign in by connecting wallet.  All the meme posts which get minted through Lens social graph store metadata on IPFS and will be on Polygon blockchain by which meme artists can also claim ownership and proof of their creative work.
-  To create a meme we need to fill up details like name, and category and select an image, add a relevant hashtag, and post it.  This meme will be posted as NFT in lens protocol terminology it's called publication.
-  Anyone who wants to create a contest can submit the details here and get SuperFun memes from the best artists.



## Challenges we ran into

- First, we got stuck in creating a profile through lens protocol's opensource social graph but their documentation is good so after so many tries we were able to fix the issues as well as got our wallet whitelisted to claim .lens handle on mainnet.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of

While creating this app we understood how important 1) Compatibility and 2) Ownership of content to the creator is. By using decentralized we can open a door to a lot of new use cases and give the best user experience to users by enabling them to have all of their content on one platform.



## What we learned

- Filecoin - IPFS is opening up many possibilities for Dapp builders to access decentralized storage solutions and make the Dapps truly decentralized and persistent. 

## What's next for SuperFun

We aim to be a go to platform for Meme Artists to generate value for their creativity and brands to create meme contests to crowdsource memes from the best artists and spread a message for their product.
